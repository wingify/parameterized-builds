Issues usually fall in one of three categories: questions, bugs, or enhancement requests

###Questions

Questions should be directed to our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/parameterized-builds/Lobby) first.

###Bugs

Bug reports should include the following information:

- Parameterized Builds for Jenkins plugin version
- Bitbucket version
- Jenkins Version
- Any Jenkins or Bitbucket settings that could be relevant
- Detailed description of the issue

In general, make the report actionable. An issue that only says "Pull request triggers do not work" does not provide
enough information to act on. However, an issue that says "Jenkins jobs located within folders cause a 'Job not found'
pop-up on Bitbucket 5.4.0, plug-in version 3.2.4, and Jenkins 2.70" is much easier to investigate.

Bugs that do not provide enough information may be closed with the "can't reproduce" label.


###Enhancement Requests

Enhancement requests are highly encouraged and should follow these guidelines:

- Use the requested feature name as the title of the issue.
- Include a description of what the feature is and the expected behaviour.
- Propose a use-case for the feature to provide context on why the feature is beneficial.
